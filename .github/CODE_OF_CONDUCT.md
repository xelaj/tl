# Behavior rules

**english** [русский](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto/blob/main/docs/ru_RU/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

In order to organize an productive communication and development environment (rather than acidic and destructive), we want to tell you about the rules of behavior in our community. there is nothing out of the ordinary here, just to remind you how good girls and boys behave.

## The first and most important rule

0. Don't be shithole. No, this rule is most important. Do **not** be shithole, please.

### Other rules

1. Respect any point of view of other people. People are mostly not stupid, and want to help. Try to make a constructive and reasoned conversation with anyone.
2. Chat with newbies kindly. This will help them to quickly roll into the community, so larger and friendlier the community is the better than small and acidic.
3. Respect what we do. Nobody is against critic, but try to do something in general, not only to please yourself, but also to the community.
4. Repeat rule #0 as a mantra. It is the most important

### What not to do

1. Trolling is not particularly appropriate. Even if the victim of your trolling is mentally retarded and does not know how to google. don't troll him, he is already swallowed: full_moon_with_face:
2. People have feelings, don't forget about it! see rule #0.
3. Don't forget about rule #0. You should never forget about it.

## Rights and obligations of maintainers

As organizers, we have our rights and responsibilities.

We are obliged:
1. Explain to each of these rules of conduct, and make sure that everyone in the community performs them <sub><sup><sub><sup>read as: do not shitholing</sup></sub></sup></sub>
2. Reject any commits, comments, issues, pool requests, anything that contradicts these rules.
3. Prevent any violations of these rules by the user, in the form of a ban, mute, or any other action that the platform allows.

## Where do these rules apply

In any community organized by the Xelaj team. In any chat rooms, repositories, groups, anywhere. In addition, these rules also apply to communities based on Xelaj communities. This means that if you represent our service, community, or simply even us as a team, you must adhere to these rules, as well as the rights and obligations of maintainers are imposed on you.

## A little about the other
By writing these rules, we followed [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org). This means that he, too, would be worth reading and generally sticking to this covenant.

Consider also that some rules can be broken in general, but we are not beasts. But the main thing: **do not be shithole** and **wish the community for good**. Good is always good.
