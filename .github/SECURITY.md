# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found any security bugs of any Xelaj maintained projects, write email to
[rcooper.xelaj@protonmail.com](mailto:rcooper.xelaj@protonmail.com) with title
'**Security problem**' and full description of exploit.

## Supported Versions

Since generics were released, and they helped us to make some important
architecture decisions, we decided to support versions since go 1.18.
