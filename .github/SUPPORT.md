# Ways to contribute, without coding, in just 5-10 minutes

<sub><sup>Want code? No worries, if you improve codebase this lib, you already know, how to make good PR ðŸ™ƒ</sup></sub>

So, you're ready to help this project, but you don't wanna code? This guide is right for you! Plenty of you wonderful people have asked how to help but don't know how to create any algorithms or even hot to write programs on golang ðŸ˜„

Fear not! There are lots of things you can do to help the project, and here we collected some amazing ideas how to make this project rock!

## Help Spread the Word

* Write any tutorials, cheatsheets or just a review (it must be honest) at any programming forums, blogs, etc. good one are [golangbridge](https://forum.golangbridge.org/), [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts), [ycombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest), [Habr](https://habr.com), (habr also welcoming english posts btw), yandex zen, etc. or any telegram channels like [gogolang](https://t.me/gogolang) (if you found any other resources, add it, just create PR here)
* Tell your friends! I mean, literally, tell someone in person, or (if Covid is still around) via some digital mechanism like chat or Zoom. If your company or team works with telegram api, tell them about it! it's dead simple, but can really help!
* Share on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, or odnoklassniki or even Friendster (jk). Anyway, post your review with link to this repo.

The more people that use the package - the better it will get. I can share with you (don't tell anyone!) that this package uses 10-50 unique people every day. it can grow up to hundreds or even thousands. So int this community we can find amazing developers which can improve this project!

## Send bug reports and ask questions

This is one of the most important contributions in any package for improving stability. Found bug? Create issue. Have some problems? ask it! (just don't ask about what food does love your cat, I mean, problems with this package)

## Improve docs or tell us about hacking package

* Did you learn how to do something cool in mtproto, but it wasn't obvious on first try? You can contribute to our documentation!
* Docs doesn't cover some specific things? tell us about that!
* you know how to do something, which this package doesn't fit? Cool, share this info about that!

## Improve current TL schema!

Unfortunately, native telegram tl schema doesn't have docs. But we love docs! So just copypaste it from official telegram docs, it would be amazing contribution!

## Another ways to contribute

This is not **full** list of ideas, how to help this project. Wait, I got another one idea: if you have more nocode contributing ideas: **make PR, post this idea here!** No seriously, we can even make standard guide how to contribute for nocoders like code of conduct but in another way, you know, "code of nocode contributors" ðŸ™ƒ
